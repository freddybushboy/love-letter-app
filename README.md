# LoveLetterGame

Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2â€“4 players (in this case 3). Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play.
